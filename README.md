This GitHub Repo holds a model for SE4CSAI project for group 'Pancakes'. The project goal is to build an AI system with a NLP model for summarization and Machine Translation.

Our model and used dataset is stored on a Google Drive shared folder due to size limitations.

To run the application, make sure the files "Streamlit_App.py", "source.model", "target.model" and the folder "ct2_model" are all in the same folder. 

Install the modules in "requirements.txt". 

Using CMD in the directory of all kept files, use "streamlit run Streamlit_App.py" to run the application
